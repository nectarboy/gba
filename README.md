# gba
My attempt at a GBA emulator before I got bored and abandoned it.

It is capable of passing a few basic tests and running a few games like kirby, but only consists of a finished cpu and unfinished ppu, without timers, dma, or any other hardware

I was learning C++ simultaneously while making this, leading to somewhat messy code and me doing a bunch of bad practices such as including all c++ files into the main c++ file
